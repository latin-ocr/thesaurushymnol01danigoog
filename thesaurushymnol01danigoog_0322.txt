remark it suggests is this, -— that Thomas of Celano seems
10 have been oi the number cs those who have one inspi-
· ration only: - the present composition being scarcely 01
second-rate merit. The second observation is suggested by
a comparish of this Sequente with the Surgit Christus
eum trophaeo, given.by Mr. Neale from aTournay Mis-
sal at p· 48 os his collection of Sequences (Brand Catal.
No. 54). One os the two is clearly a parody 01 the other
-as both, at the end, borrow from the Victimae paschali.
The following imitatione are obvious:

Dic Maria, quid iecisti Dic l'rancisce quid iecisti
Postquam Christum amisisti? Postquam Iesum aspexisti?

Dio Maria quid vidisti Dic Francisce quod iecisti
’ Contemplando crucem Christi? Contemplando plagas Christi?

Certe multis argumentis Certe multis argumentis ·
Signa vidi resurgentis. Constat forma redimentis. ὁ

There is one other Sequente (in the Mayence books)

· - addressed to the Blessed Virgini, clearly cast in the same

monld. We are disposed to think (notwithstanding the rnle¹
that‚,in cases os parody‚ the more particular is borrowed
from the more general hymn) that the Sequence to S. Fran·
· cis must have been the basis os the two others.“
